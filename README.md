# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
The aim of this project is to predict whether a credit card transaction is fraudulent or not, based on the transaction amount, location and other transaction related data. In  this project I used the models like logistic regression, SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, etc. I also learned how to deal with the imbalanced dataset using SMOTE technique. Also, I made a Deep Learning Model.
